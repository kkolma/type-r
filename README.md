# type-r

type-r is a simple typing shooter game built with Phaser 3. Words fall from the top of the screen and you must type them to destroy them.

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Once running, letters will fall from the top. Hit the first letter of a word to lock on and then finish typing it. Correct letters flash as you type.
